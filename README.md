> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Update (July 2026): Claude now ships official RTL support — and the patch has been redesigned to build on top of it.**
> Anthropic added native RTL rendering to the **Code tab**, and the code for the regular **Chat tab** is already present (currently disabled, likely rolling out soon). This is genuinely good news, and hopefully this patch will become unnecessary altogether before long.
> For now, though, the native logic still has real gaps: no per-cell table direction, no handling of mixed-language lines, mixed lists judged by their first item only, no math/LaTeX isolation, and nothing at all for user messages, the input box, or the rest of the UI. The broken window UI on RTL systems is also still not fixed natively — including the preview window it pushes off to the far left.
> The patch has therefore been comprehensively reworked to **merge with Claude's native RTL instead of fighting it**: wherever native support exists it is left untouched, and the patch's detection engine fills in everything native still misses. When Anthropic enables native RTL in the Chat tab, the patch will step back there automatically — no update needed.

---

## ✨ What it does

- **Auto-detects RTL text** in Claude's responses and the input box, and aligns the direction in real time, even while a reply is still streaming.
- **Handles code, math formulas, and tables** — code blocks and LaTeX (`$x^2$`, `$$…$$`) stay left-to-right inside Hebrew, and Hebrew tables read right-to-left.
- **Fixes the broken window UI on RTL systems** (see the note below).
- **Backs up every file it touches**, with one-click restore and automatic rollback if anything goes wrong.
- **Stays applied across updates** (optional), via a desktop shortcut or a background auto-updater.

> [!NOTE]
> On a Windows system whose display language is set to Hebrew/Arabic, Claude Desktop's entire window UI flips to RTL on its own. This is a pre-existing bug, not caused by the patch. It pushes the title-bar window controls (minimize / maximize / close) on top of Claude's own settings and navigation buttons, hiding them, and sends the preview window to the far left. The patch fixes this by forcing the window chrome back to LTR, without affecting the direction of the chat text itself.

## 🚀 Quick install

Open **Windows PowerShell** and run:

```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shraga100/claude-desktop-rtl-patch/main/install.ps1 | iex
```

A UAC prompt will appear. Click **Yes** to grant administrator privileges, then choose **1. Install** from the menu.

> [!TIP]
> Prefer not to pipe to `iex`? Download `patch.ps1` from the repo, right-click it, and choose **Run with PowerShell**.

---

## 📋 Requirements

| Requirement | Notes |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Windows 10 / 11** | With Claude Desktop installed ([download](https://downloads.claude.ai/releases/win32/ClaudeSetup.exe)) |
| **Node.js** | `npx` must be on your PATH ([nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/)), used to repack the app archive |
| **Administrator** | The installer elevates automatically via UAC |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Windows only.** On macOS, use [soguy's Mac patch](https://github.com/soguy/claude-desktop-rtl-mac) instead. *(I haven't personally tested the Mac version, use at your own risk.)*

---

## 🎛️ Menu options

When you run the script, you get an interactive menu:

| # | Option | What it does |
| :---: | :--- | :--- |
| **1** | Install Smart RTL Patch | Backs up the originals and injects RTL support |
| **2** | Restore Original State | Reverts every change the patch made |
| **3** | Create 'Quick Update' Shortcut | Adds a desktop shortcut for one-click re-patching |
| **4** | Enable Auto Re-Patch | Installs a background watcher that re-patches after each Claude update |
| **5** | Disable Auto Re-Patch | Removes that background watcher |
| **6** | Exit | Close the patcher |

---

## 🔄 Keeping the patch applied

Claude Desktop updates often, and each update overwrites the patch. Two optional features keep it effortless:

- **Quick Update shortcut (option 3):** a desktop shortcut named **"Update Claude RTL"**. Double-click it to silently fetch and re-apply the latest patch.
- **Auto-updater (option 4):** a lightweight Windows scheduled task that detects when a new `claude.exe` version launches, re-applies the patch automatically, and shows a notification when it's done.

---

## 🗑️ Uninstall

Run the script and choose **2. Restore Original State**. This restores all original files from backup and removes the self-signed certificate from your Windows certificate store. If you enabled the auto-updater, choose **5. Disable Auto Re-Patch** as well.

---

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

**"Node.js (npx) is required":** Install Node.js from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/) and reopen PowerShell.

**Claude won't start after patching:** Run the script again, choose **2 (Restore)**, then **1 (Install)**.

**Claude updated and the patch broke:** Run the "Update Claude RTL" shortcut, or use the auto-updater. To fix it manually, delete any `.bak` files in the Claude app directory and run the installer again.

**`Import-Module … The member AuditToString is already present`:** You ran the command in **PowerShell 7 (`pwsh`)**, which has a known bug that breaks the patch. Use the built-in **Windows PowerShell** instead:

1. Press **Win + R**, type `powershell`, and press **Enter**. This opens the classic **blue** Windows PowerShell window (not the black `pwsh` one).
2. Paste the install command and run it.

<details>
<summary><b>🔍 How it works (technical)</b></summary>

Claude Desktop is a **digitally signed** Electron app, so editing its UI code breaks the integrity checks. The patch works around this in three phases, all atomic, with automatic rollback on failure:

**Phase 1, ASAR injection.** Claude's UI lives inside `app.asar`. The script extracts it with `npx @electron/asar`, prepends the RTL-detection payload to the renderer files (and forces the window UI to LTR in the main process), repacks the archive, and computes its new SHA-256 header hash. The payload's detection logic lives in [`src/rtl-core.js`](src/rtl-core.js) (pure, unit-tested) plus [`src/rtl-payload.js`](src/rtl-payload.js) (DOM layer); `tools/build-payload.ps1` assembles them into `patch.ps1`.

**Phase 2, hash replacement in `claude.exe`.** The original ASAR hash is stored as an ASCII string inside `claude.exe`. The script does a byte-level search-and-replace to update it. If the format ever changes, it falls back to disabling the Electron integrity fuse.

**Phase 3, certificate swap in `cowork-svc.exe`.** This service verifies `claude.exe` against Anthropic's embedded certificate. The script locates that certificate (by pattern-matching around the `"Anthropic, PBC"` string), replaces it in-place with a self-signed one (padded with `0x00` to keep the file size), re-signs both binaries, adds the new certificate to the Windows trusted root store, and then wipes the private key.

All original files are backed up as `.bak` next to the originals before anything changes.

<details>
<summary><b>🔐 Security & verification</b></summary>

`install.ps1` verifies an **RSA-4096 signature** over `patch.ps1` before running it. A compromised GitHub repo alone is **not** enough to ship malicious code; the attacker would also need the maintainer's offline private key.

**Public-key fingerprint (SHA-256):**

```
6e:f4:c2:a6:c2:42:34:a1:5f:e5:cd:e5:5d:a5:b0:3c:94:64:b4:56:7f:81:04:7c:83:9a:50:1c:7c:6f:07:c9
```

To double-check, recompute the fingerprint of the key embedded in `install.ps1` and confirm it matches:

```powershell
$content = Invoke-RestMethod "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shraga100/claude-desktop-rtl-patch/main/install.ps1"
if ($content -match "ExpectedPubKey\s*=\s*'([A-Za-z0-9+/=]+)'") {
    $bytes = [Convert]::FromBase64String($matches[1])
    $hash  = [System.Security.Cryptography.SHA256]::Create().ComputeHash($bytes)
    ([BitConverter]::ToString($hash)).Replace('-', ':').ToLower()
}
```

A mismatch means the embedded key was swapped. **Do not proceed**, and report it as a security issue.

To audit a release without installing:

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/shraga100/claude-desktop-rtl-patch
cd claude-desktop-rtl-patch
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File tools\verify-signature.ps1
```

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

> [!CAUTION]
> This patch modifies Claude Desktop's binaries. It replaces Anthropic's code-signing certificate inside `cowork-svc.exe` with a self-signed one, adds that certificate to your Windows **trusted root store**, and bypasses the app's integrity verification.

By installing, you accept that:

1. **You use it at your own risk.** The authors take no responsibility for system damage, data loss, or instability.
2. **Modifying the app may not align with Anthropic's Terms of Service.** It's worth reviewing them and using your own judgment.
3. **You trust this repository.** Running `irm | iex` as Administrator executes code with full privileges, so always verify the source.
4. **It's temporary.** Claude updates overwrite the patched files, so re-run the installer (or use the auto-updater) after each update.
5. **It's a stopgap** until Anthropic adds native RTL support. Please request that feature through official channels.
